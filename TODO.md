### Requirements

 - subcommands
 - automatic convert parameters and validate them (int, inclusion in list, ...)
 - automatic documentation (man, --help, html reference)
 - inspectable model
 - reusable/embeddable components. e.g. include the same set of
   commands in multiple places but with different settings.
 - automatic bash auto completion
 - can be invoked without CLI by calling functions => easy to test
 - use helper methods in each command
 - library for: progress bar, spinner, notifications
